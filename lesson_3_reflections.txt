When would you want to create a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

When u work in team so u need to see updates of each 
other.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository? 

Because sometimes you don't want to update your current file
f.e. u haven't tested it yet or u want to upload it with few 
new features.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - clones the repository in github. Clone - copies 
the repository from "the internet" to the local machine.
Branches - when you start to experiment with your main file 
without damaging - you create it's "copy" that you can change 
as you wish.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state 
of the remote stored locally? 

To make a correct merge. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What 
would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git is easier than without GitHub, because we have 
the Internet. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather
than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you are not sure whether to make a change or not, so you want 
to know what other people/smb else think about it.

Test after the reset
