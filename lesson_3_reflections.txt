When would you want to create a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

When u work in team so u need to see updates of each 
other.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository? 

Because sometimes you don't want to update your current file
f.e. u haven't tested it yet or u want to upload it with few 
new features.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - clones the repository in github. Clone - copies 
the repository from "the internet" to the local machine.
Branches - when you start to experiment with your main file 
without damaging - you create it's "copy" that you can change 
as you wish.
