When would you want to create a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

When u work in team so u need to see updates of each 
other.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository? 

Because sometimes you don't want to update your current file
f.e. u haven't tested it yet or u want to upload it with few 
new features.
